\usage{
dlGeneric(url, needChecksums, destinationPath)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{The url (link) to the file.}

\item{needChecksums}{Logical indicating whether to generate checksums.

## TODO: add overwrite arg to the function?}

\item{destinationPath}{Character string of a directory in which to download
and save the file that comes from \code{url} and is also where the function
will look for \code{archive} or \code{targetFile}. NOTE (still experimental):
To prevent repeated downloads in different locations, the user can also set
\code{options("reproducible.inputPaths")} to one or more local file paths to
search for the file before attempting to download. Default for that option is
\code{NULL} meaning do not search locally.}
